      You may need to provide Your Information to participate in certain Spoken Inc programs and activities or receive certain services or offers. Any actual purchases offered on our site involve providing Your Information to a third-party service provider, in this case, Apple via the App Store. In these circumstances, you will know that you are on another website because the URL will change.

However, no transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so you provide Your Information at your own risk.<br/>
